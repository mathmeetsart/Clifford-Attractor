# Clifford Attractor

Welcome to the Clifford Attractor repository! Explore the captivating world of chaotic dynamics and strange attractors.
<br/><br/>

## Description

The Clifford Attractor is a chaotic dynamical system first described by Clifford A. Pickover in 1990. It is a two-dimensional attractor that exhibits complex behavior when iterated over time. The Clifford Attractor is characterized by its intricate and unpredictable trajectory, making it a fascinating subject of study in nonlinear dynamics.

## Code

Explore the code used to visualize the Clifford Attractor. The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as matplotlib and numpy.

### Requirements

- Python 3.12
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

### Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `clifford_attractor_animation.py` file.
2. Make sure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `clifford_attractor_animation.py`.
5. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python clifford_attractor_animation.py
    ```

6. The script will generate a plot of the Clifford Attractor and display it in a new window.

### Customization

You can customize the behavior and appearance of the plot by modifying the parameters in the script:

- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`: Parameters controlling the transformation equations of the Clifford attractor.
- `x`, `y`: Initial coordinates of the attractor.
- `num_points`: Number of points to generate in the attractor.

### Saving the Plot

You can save the plot as an image file by uncommenting the following line in the script:

```python
# plt.savefig("clifford_attractor.png", dpi=1200)  # Save the plot as a PNG file with high resolution
